# Hackathon GoogleCloud for climate - Datact
Agris business is responsible of 30% of the world carbon emissions.  
Along with 8 other students, we created an SAAS B2B platform to assist product designers and purchasing managers in the eco-conception and eco-supply of agri-food products.  
  
We built an ingredient recommandation algorithm that takes into account the carbon emissions, the seasonality and the similarity with the initial ingredient.  
The similarity was obtained by cleaning 80 000 recipes and applying on then the Google NLP model word2vec.  
    
The tool was built on Datastudio and is available here :

The final presentation was held in front of 6 people having sustainability positions of responsability in different sectors (Google Cloud, Renault, Thales, INRIA, PRAIRIES).  
  
For this project, our team was awarded with the 1st place :trophy:    
You can find in this repository the notebooks that conducted the analysis, as well as the final functions and the final presentation.
